## 🌸 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning application that:
- Classifies iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica
- Uses a Random Forest classifier for predictions
- Provides an interactive web interface built with Streamlit
- Deploys a fully functional ML model with a clean UI

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the famous Iris dataset, which contains:
- 150 samples of iris flowers
- 3 species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica
- 4 features for each sample:
  - Sepal length (cm)
  - Sepal width (cm)
  - Petal length (cm)
  - Petal width (cm)

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Input**: Adjustable sliders for flower measurements
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant species classification as you adjust values
- **Probability Display**: Shows confidence levels for each prediction
- **Model Insights**: Displays feature importance and dataset information
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
