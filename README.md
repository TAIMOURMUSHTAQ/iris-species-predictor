# Iris Flower Classification App
A machine learning web application that predicts iris flower species based on their measurements using a Random Forest classifier.

## 🌸 Overview
•	This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning application that:
•	Classifies iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica
•	Uses a Random Forest classifier for predictions
•	Provides an interactive web interface built with Streamlit
•	Deploys a fully functional ML model with a clean UI


## 📊 Dataset
The model is trained on the famous Iris dataset, which contains:
•	150 samples of iris flowers
•	3 species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica
•	4 features for each sample:
•	Sepal length (cm)
•	Sepal width (cm)
•	Petal length (cm)
•	Petal width (cm)

## 🚀 Features
•	**Interactive Input**: Adjustable sliders for flower measurements
•	**Real-time Predictions**: Instant species classification as you adjust values
•	**Probability Display**: Shows confidence levels for each prediction
•	**Model Insights**: Displays feature importance and dataset information
•	**Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
