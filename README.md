## 🌸 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning application that:
- Classifies iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica
- Uses a Random Forest classifier for predictions
- Provides an interactive web interface built with Streamlit
- Deploys a fully functional ML model with a clean UI

## 📊 Dataset

The model is trained on the famous Iris dataset, which contains:
- 150 samples of iris flowers
- 3 species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica
- 4 features for each sample:
  - Sepal length (cm)
  - Sepal width (cm)
  - Petal length (cm)
  - Petal width (cm)

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive Input**: Adjustable sliders for flower measurements
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant species classification as you adjust values
- **Probability Display**: Shows confidence levels for each prediction
- **Model Insights**: Displays feature importance and dataset information
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## 🚀 Deployment Guide

### Streamlit Sharing
1. Ensure your app works locally: `streamlit run app.py`
2. Create a GitHub repository and push your code
3. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io/)
4. Click "New app" and connect your GitHub account
5. Select your repository, branch, and main file path (`app.py`)
6. Click "Deploy" - your app will be live in minutes!

### Heroku Deployment
1. Install Heroku CLI and login: `heroku login`
2. Create a `Procfile` with: `web: streamlit run app.py --server.port=$PORT`
3. Create a `setup.sh` file with:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.streamlit/
   echo "[server]
   headless = true
   port = $PORT
   enableCORS = false
   " > ~/.streamlit/config.toml
4.	Add both files to your repository
5.	Create Heroku app: heroku create your-app-name
6.	Deploy: git push heroku main
